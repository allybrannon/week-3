    <p>At length they came to a bee's nest, in which there was so much honey
        that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was.  The two
        wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, and suffocate the bees in
        order to take away the honey, but simpleton again stopped them and
        said, leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to burn
        them.

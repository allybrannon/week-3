    <p>At length the three brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses
        were standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen, and
        they went through all the halls until, quite at the end, they came to
        a door in which were three locks.  In the middle of the door,
        however, there was a little pane, through which they could see into
        the room.  There they saw a little grey man, who was sitting at a
        table.  They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear, at last
        they called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks,
        and came out.  He said nothing, however, but conducted them to a
        handsomely-spread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took
        each of them to a bedroom.

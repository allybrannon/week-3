    <p>The first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the
        princess's pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up, and
        if by sunset one single pearl was missing, he who had looked for them
        would be turned into stone.  The eldest went thither, and sought the
        whole day, but when it came to an end, he had only found one hundred,
        and what was written on the table came true, and he was turned into
        stone. Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure, but it
        did not fare much better with him than with the eldest, he did not
        find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.  At last
        it was simpleton's turn to seek in the moss, but it was so difficult
        for him to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated
        himself on a stone, and wept.  And while he was thus sitting, the
        king of the ants whose life he had once saved, came with five
        thousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the
        pearls together, and laid them in a heap.

        My thoughts:  
    </h2>
    <p>Strange that I stumbled upon this story. This is something that I think of often.
        As a vegetarian, I <em>really</em> try not to kill anything I come across.  Except
        mosquitos and cockroaches.  Ants, other flying bugs (not mosquitos), moths, bees...
        if I find them in my home, I try my best to take them outside where they are meant 
        to be. Cockroaches and mosquitos- are not so lucky and usually die at first sight.  
        I hope God (whoever) forgives me for those.
